## 🖥️ Backend API Setup (Optional)

The extension can work with a backend server for advanced features:

### Why Use a Backend?
- **Advanced Content Analysis**: AI-powered website categorization
- **Centralized Management**: Control multiple devices from one dashboard
- **Detailed Analytics**: Advanced reporting and insights
- **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notifications to parents

### Backend Technologies Recommended

#### Option 1: Node.js/Express (Recommended)
```javascript
// Simple Express.js server
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// Website analysis endpoint
app.post('/api/analyze', (req, res) => {
  const { domain, url, profileId } = req.body;
  
  // Your content analysis logic
  const categories = analyzeContent(domain, url);
  
  res.json({
    categories: categories,
    riskLevel: 'low',
    confidence: 0.95
  });
});

// Activity logging endpoint
app.post('/api/log-visit', (req, res) => {
  const { domain, url, profileId, timestamp } = req.body;
  
  // Store in database
  saveToDatabase(req.body);
  
  res.json({ status: 'logged' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('API server running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Option 2: Python/Flask
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze_website():
    data = request.json
    domain = data['domain']
    
    # Your analysis logic here
    categories = analyze_content(domain)
    
    return jsonify({
        'categories': categories,
        'riskLevel': 'low',
        'confidence': 0.95
    })

@app.route('/api/log-visit', methods=['POST'])
def log_visit():
    data = request.json
    # Store in database
    save_to_db(data)
    return jsonify({'status': 'logged'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=3000)
```

### Setting Up the Backend Connection
